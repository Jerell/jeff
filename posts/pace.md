I started working at Pace Flow Assurance in January 2018.  
As a data analyst, I use **Python** and **Excel** to process data for oil and gas pipeline simulations:

- I used `Python` to manipulate input and output files for sequential simulations, reducing the overall run time by creating a moving area of high detail that progresses along the pipeline as the simulation runs in steps, as opposed to simulating the entire pipeline in high detail.
- I co-authored a [published paper](https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/BHR-2019-023) on the use of algorithms to optimise the design of subsea pipelines.
- I use `Python` libraries such as `Pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visualisations.

I'm responsible for the development of web applications used internally. These are mostly built with **React** and **NodeJS** (Express)

- I designed and built a _project management_ application used by all employees to track time and resources spent on different projects.
- I developed a _document control_ application used to track the issue status of project deliverables
- I created an application that generates PDFs in a custom format using JSON data.
