          <p>My idea for a programming project is to make a website that solves sudoku puzzles.</p>
          <p>It would mean making an algorithm to take the initial puzzle as an input, process the current state of the puzzle and loop until it is complete.</p>
          <p>I think this makes a good project because it has a clear use and end state and is easier to verify than something like a crossword.</p>
          <p>I have a basic idea of how to create the program but I haven't worked out the details and I'm a bit out of practice so I imagine it would take a significant amount of time.</p>
          <p>I could create the program as its own thing but I think it needs to be paired with a website so I can have an interface that's easier to use than a command line.</p>

      <div class="one-half column">
        <img src="images/sudoku image.png" class="centre-block h300"/>
          <aside>The process would start by ruling out numbers in rows and columns.</aside>
          <!-- I initially used divs to highlight the rows because I was going to make them appear when a button was pressed but then I resized the window and saw I would have to make their positioning relative to the image which was more work.

        <p>I could write it in C but that makes input and output more difficult so I think javascript is the way to go.</p>
        <p>I only know how to create menu based command line interfaces using C and javascript allows me to input all the numbers into a grid of text boxes on a webpage and have a separate submit button.</p>
        <p>This is important because it means each number can be edited individually without starting the input again if a mistake is made.</p>
